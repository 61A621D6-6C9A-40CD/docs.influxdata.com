## agent

An agent is the core part of Telegraf that gathers metrics from the declared inputs and sends to the declared outputs, based on the plugins enabled by the given configuration.

## aggregator plugin 

Aggregator Plugins receive raw metrics from input plugins and create aggregate metrics from them. 
The aggregate metrics are then passed to the configured output plugins.

## batch size 

The Telegraf agent sends metrics to outputs in batches, not individually. 
The batch size controls the size of each write batch that Telegraf sends to the output plugins.

## collection interval

The default global interval for collecting data from each input plugin. 
The collection interval can be overridden by each individual input plugin's configuration.

## collection jitter

Collection jitter is used to prevent every input plugin from collecting metrics simultaneously, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
Each collection interval, every input plugin will sleep for a random time between zero and the collection jitter before collecting the metrics.

## flush interval

The global interval for flushing data from each output plugin to its destination. 
This value should not be set lower than the collection interval.

## flush jitter

Flush jitter is used to prevent every output plugin from sending writes simultaneously, which can overwhelm some data sinks.
Each flush interval, every output plugin will sleep for a random time between zero and the flush jitter before emitting metrics. 
This helps smooth out write spikes when running a large number of telegraf instances.

## input plugin

Input plugins gather metrics and deliver them to the core agent. In order to activate an input plugin, it needs to be enabled and configured in the corresponding section in the given config file.

## metric buffer

The Telegraf agent will individually cache metrics for each output when writes are failing for the output plugin. Telegraf will flush this buffer upon a successful write. Oldest metrics are dropped first when this buffer fills.

## output plugin

Output plugins deliver metrics to their configured destination. In order to activate an output plugin, it needs to be enabled and configured in the corresponding section in the given config file.

## precision

Precision is the timestamp order with valid values being "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s".
Precision settings are not used for service input plugins.

## processor plugin 

Processor Plugins transform, decorate, and/or filter metrics and run in between input and output plugins.

## service input plugin

Service input plugins are a special type of input plugins that run in a backgrounded/detached mode while the Telegraf agent is up and running. They can implement a known protocol while listening for inputs on a socket, or actively apply their own logic to collect metrics and deliver them to the Telegraf agent at will.
