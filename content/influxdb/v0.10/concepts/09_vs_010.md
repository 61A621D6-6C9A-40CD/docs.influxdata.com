This page aims to ease the transition to InfluxDB 0.10 for those more familiar with 0.9.
It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of the differences between the versions.

There are not many breaking changes between InfluxDB version 0.9 and InfluxDB version 0.10.
* Control over the execution of Continuous Queries is now part of the query definition, not the config file 
* `tsm` is the only storage engine available in InfluxDB 0.10, although the system can still read `b1` and `bz1` shards 
* Clustering implementation has incompatible improvements over the alpha functionality in InfluxDB 0.9 

## Continuous Query Configuration

In InfluxDB 0.9 `CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY` statements only define the query to be performed. Settings in the `[continuous_queries]` section of the configuration file control the frequency of the execution of continuous queries (CQs) and how much historical data they would query. All CQs shared the same configuration settings, making it difficult to optimize for both short and long sampling intervals.

In InfluxDB 0.10 `CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY` statements explicitly declare the frequency at which that individual CQ should run. It is now possible to have a `GROUP BY time(1m)` query that runs every 15 seconds over the previous 10 one-minute intervals, while simultaneously having a `GROUP BY time(1w)` query that runs once per day and resamples data up to six weeks out of date.

> **Note:** Continuous queries defined in InfluxDB 0.9 will still execute in InfluxDB 0.10, but at a reduced frequency and with no resampling of data. It is urgently recommended that you update your continuous queries to the new 0.10 syntax to avoid incomplete downsampling. 

## Data Storage Engine

InfluxDB 0.9 defaulted to using [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) for the underlying storage files. The storage engine was referred to as the `b1` engine, or `bz1` for versions 0.9.3+ that supported compression of the BoltDB files. As the database matured and performance improved, it became clear that BoltDB would not scale to the target performance. Starting with InfluxDB 0.9.4 the [Time Structured Merge tree]((https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/concepts/storage_engine.html#the-new-influxdb-storage-engine-from-lsm-tree-to-b-tree-and-back-again-to-create-the-time-structured-merge-tree)) engine (`tsm`) was added as an available storage engine. It was never the default engine for any 0.9.x version of InfluxDB. 

With InfluxDB 0.10, `tsm` is the only option for new shards. While InfluxDB 0.10.0 can read the older `b1` and `bz1` shards from InfluxDB 0.9, it will only create new `tsm` shards. InfluxData recommends [converting](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/cmd/influx_tsm/README.md) all legacy shards to `tsm` shards as soon as feasible. `tsm` is more performant and stable and will result in a significant reduction in disk usage.

## Clustering 

TODO: how has clustering changed?
