To upgrade to InfluxDB 0.11, you must be on version 0.10 and all shards must be in `TSM` format (the default storage engine starting with InfluxDB 0.10).
See the [0.10 documentation](/influxdb/v0.10/administration/upgrading/#convert-b1-and-bz1-shards-to-tsm1) for how to convert `b1` and `bz1` shards to `TSM`.
If any `b1` or `bz1` shards are present, InfluxDB 0.11 will not start.

> **Identifying non-`TSM` shards**
>
In your [data directory](/influxdb/v0.12/administration/config/#dir-var-lib-influxdb-data):
>
* Non-`TSM` shards are files of the form: `data/<database>/<retention_policy>/<shard_id>`
* `TSM` shards are files of the form: `data/<database>/<retention_policy>/<shard_id>/<file>.tsm`

Additional considerations when upgrading to 0.11:

* [Generate a new configuration file](/influxdb/v0.12/administration/upgrading/#generate-a-new-configuration-file)
* [Review queries affected by the breaking API changes](/influxdb/v0.12/administration/upgrading/#review-queries-affected-by-the-breaking-api-changes)

## Generate a new configuration file

InfluxDB 0.11 has several new settings in the [configuration file](/influxdb/v0.12/administration/config/).

The `influxd config` command prints out a new TOML-formatted configuration with all the available configuration options set to their default values.
On POSIX systems, a new configuration file can be generated by redirecting the output of the command to a file.

```
influxd config > /etc/influxdb/influxdb_012.conf.generated
```

Compare your InfluxDB 0.10 configuration file against the newly generated [InfluxDB 0.11 file](/influxdb/v0.12/administration/config/) and manually update any defaults with your localized settings.

## Review queries affected by the breaking API changes
We recommend reviewing any queries affected by the [breaking API changes](/influxdb/v0.12/concepts/010_vs_011/#breaking-api-changes) released with InfluxDB 0.11.
